        <p>I recreated my bedroom in the program SketchUp with great accuracy.
            I've actually done this twice now, because I accidentally deleted it once when I was transfering to a new computer setup. 
            All measurements are roughly within 1/16th-1/8th of an inch of reality.
            Besides just being kinda cool, this model allows me to add things to my room digitally before doing so in real life.
            Since making this, I've added a bunch of things like shelves, a couch, a rug, and many decorations to my room.
            Many of these things were added to my model first to see if I liked how it fit in my room.
            I'm considering updating the model, but I recently started learning Blender and I am considering starting from scratch in Blender.
