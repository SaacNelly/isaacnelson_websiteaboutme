        <h2>My Goals</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>Most of my goals are somewhat basic. I want a decent paying job, a house with a big garage, the ability to pursue my hobbies/interests, and maybe even a family some day.
            I'll dive into a couple of those goals a little deeper.
            Regarding a job, I'm not really sure what I want to do yet. I enjoy computer science and am getting a CIS degree, so something in that field would be a good choice, but 
            I've also considered other options like starting my own business. I think it would be really nice to work for myself. Both of my parents started their own businesses so I wouldn't be suprised if I follow suit some day.
            My house goal will likely depend on whether I get a good job or not.
            I am fairly confident in my ability to learn and complete just about any handiwork so I'm hoping I'll be able to snag a crappy house for cheap and fix it up.
            Pursuing my hobbies kind of falls in line with the house because of my interest in cars. I would love to have a 2-3 car garage with a lift so I can work on my cars more easily.
